'''''Encephalitozoon intestinalis''''' is a [[parasitism|parasite]].<ref name=Doed1998/> It can cause [[microsporidiosis]].<ref name=Lanternier2009/>

It is notable as having one of the smallest [[genome]] among known [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms, containing only 2.25 million base pairs.<ref name="scienceshot"/> Its genome was completely [[genome sequencing|sequenced]] in 2010.<ref name=Corradi2010/>

''E. intestinalis'' originally named Septata intestinalis, was reclassified based on morphologic, antigenic
and molecular similarities with other species of the genus Encephalitozoon. Recently, Some domestic
and wild animals have been found to be naturally infected with ''E. intestinalis'' and some other
microsporidian species.<ref name="Prevention 2013">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2013.</ref>

''E. intestinalis'' is transmitted in contaminated water. It causes Gastro-Intestinal tract infection which
subsequently leads to diarrhea and circulates to the ocular, [[genitourinary]] and respiratory tracts.
Research has proven that ''E. intestinalis'' infection can increase host cell nuclear mutation rate.<ref name="Prevention 2013"/>

== Genome ==
Compared to ''E. cuniculi'' which encodes about 2000 massive genes at 2.9 Mbp, ''E. intestinalis'' had a reduced gene complement and genome size (2.3 Mbp) because of a high degree of host dependency. ''E. intestinalis'' lack large gene blocks of sequence in its subtelomeric regions unlike ''E. cuniculi''. However, ''E. intestinalis'' and ''E. cuniculi'' share a conserved gene content, order and density
over most of their [[genomes]] which have similar GC content. They also contain the same
complement of transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs.<ref>[[Macmillan Publishers Limited]]. 2010.</ref>

''Microsporidia'' are obligate intracellular opportunistic fungi that cause significant pathology in
immunocompromised (simply put: having an impaired immune system) hosts. Like other
obligate intracellular pathogens, ''microsporidia'' exert significant stress on infected host cells.
''Microsporidia'' infection alters host cell cycle regulation and can lead to development of
multinucleated host cells.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

=== Detection ===
The assay is adaptable to the clinical laboratory and represents the first real‐time PCR assay
designed to detect Encephalitozoon species. Melting temperature analysis of the amplicons
allows for the differentiation of three Encephalitozoon species (E. intestinalis, E. cuniculi,  and E.hellem).<ref>D. M. Wolk, S. K. Schneider, N. L. Wengenack, L. M. Sloan, and J. E. Rosenblatt.</ref>

=== Treatment ===
Frequent washing of hands and limited exposure to animals is highly recommended especially for
people with immunesystem deficiency.  Treatment of Microsporidia can vary depending on the
species involved. Intravenous fluid administration, electrolyte repletion, dietary and nutritional
regimens can be helpful to patients with diarrhea while antiretroviral therapy can help improve
immune system function.<ref>Steven Doerr, MD  Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD.</ref>
